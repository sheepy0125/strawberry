# Strawberry

Complementing chocolate and vanilla, here we have strawberry

Strawberry aims to provide what [libdrc](https://bitbucket.org/memahaxx/libdrc/src/master/) did 11-ish years ago, but rewritten in rust, and hopefully better (eventually...)

Using this crate requires patched versions of libx264, hostapd, the `mac80211` kernel module, and possibly patching your wireless adapter drivers. (Partially outdated) instructions can be found on [libdrc.org](https://libdrc.org). todo: elaborate further
